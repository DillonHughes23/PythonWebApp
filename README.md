DATA STRUCTURES WEB APP


Recreate the python roadmap but make it interactive with multiple layers to the app.
Make the it look very modern.



	Front End
Javascript, React, html, CSS

	Backend 
SQL for querying, any db

	Version Control
Github, a progress tracker





	Home Page
Have tabs for links and about me.
Have a search bar to look for the algorithm or data structure.
Have the entire roadmap be the home page where you click on each of the sections in the roadmap it will bring you to that page.





Project Name: Data Structures Web App

Purpose:The primary goal of this project is to focus on coding Python data structures and algorithms while integrating a basic web app with a functional backend. This project aims to create a simple, interactive version of the Python roadmap where users can view and explore the most efficient Python code implementations for various data structures and algorithms.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS

Backend: SQL for querying, any database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)

Version Control: GitHub

Progress Tracker: GitHub Projects or Issues

Features:


    Home Page:
  
  Tabs for links (e.g., "Roadmap," "About Me")
  
  The roadmap as the main content of the home page.
  
  Clickable sections within the roadmap to navigate to dedicated pages for each topic.
  
  
    Interactive Roadmap:
  
  Visual representation of the Python roadmap.
  
  Each node in the roadmap represents a different data structure or algorithm.
  
  Clicking on a node navigates to a detailed page that displays the most efficient Python code for that topic.
  
  Algorithm/Data Structure Pages:
  
  Each page contains the following information:
  
  The most efficient Python code implementations.
  
  Short explanations of the code.
  
  Simple layout focused on readability.

  
  
    Database Integration:
  
  Store Python code for various data structures and algorithms.
  
  Use SQL to query and fetch code based on user interactions.
  
  Basic Search Functionality:
  
  Search for data structures or algorithms using keywords.
  
  Modern Design:
  
  Implement a clean, modern aesthetic with CSS.
  
  Responsive design for different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
